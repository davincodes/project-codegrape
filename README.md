# CODEGRAPE : A DEEP LEARNING BASED IMAGE RECOGNITION SYSTEM FOR AUTOMATED DETECTION OF GRAPE LEAF DISEASES

## Overview

I am exploring agricultural technology and augmentation approaches to develop a reliable solution for the challenges faced by grape farmers. One of the key issues in the grape farms of Bauang, La Union, is the difficulty in identifying grape leaf diseases, which can significantly impact crop yield and quality. Farmers often struggle to recognize specific diseases, leading to delayed or ineffective treatments that harm productivity.

To address this, I have developed a web-based tool called CODEGRAPE it is powered by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to assist in diagnosing grape leaf diseases. Designed specifically to help farmers in Bauang, La Union, this system allows users to upload images of their grape leaves and receive an accurate diagnosis. By leveraging advanced image recognition, the tool simplifies the disease identification process, providing farmers with timely and reliable information.

With an intuitive interface, the platform makes it easy to upload, classify, and access detailed descriptions of potential diseases. In addition to diagnosis, the system offers expert-recommended treatment options, helping farmers take immediate action to protect their crops. This technology aims to bridge the gap in disease identification and empower grape farmers with the tools they need to ensure healthier, more productive vineyards.
